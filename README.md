## Program Name _Pizza Shop_ 4th Independent Project

## Description

This webpage is an exercise designed to take user input for a custom pizza order with designated limitations. Once the 'Add to cart' button is clicked, the output is the user's selected pizza order with the price of there order based on the amount of toppings and size of the pizza. This was my project to test me on my understanding and skill with the use of constructors and prototypes in JavaScript.

### Specs

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-----------------    | :------------------ | :-------------- |

| Returns an alert message when no size is selected. | _Input:_ "Click to choose size" | _Output:_ (Pop-up):"Please choose a size to complete your order." |
